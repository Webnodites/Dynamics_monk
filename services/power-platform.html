Simply point Power Apps at the data source of your choice (for example, a list in Microsoft SharePoint or Microsoft Dataverse), and watch as Power Apps automatically builds a three-screen app. This three-screen app lets you display, edit, delete, and create records.

                            <p>As an App Maker, before you begin building your Power Apps solution, it's recommended to go through a design process. When designing your Power Apps solution, there are several different factors to consider, such as</p>

                                    <p>By challenging the existing process and asking what it is the business needs to do, not what does the piece of paper or old software allows you to do, it opens the possibility of better, more efficient processes. For example, maybe on the paper process, the user had to type notes about what they see. Would it be better instead to just take a picture? This type of thinking will lead to better apps and better outcomes.</p>

                                    <p>Every app you develop will have a different set of business requirements based on the solution. Taking the time to think about all the requirements is key to rolling out a successful production app.</p>

Maybe you already have a data source implemented that users work with on a day to day basis, like SharePoint. Could you just use this as your data source to build your app?

                                    <p>By designing your Power Apps solution in a Canvas app, you have complete control of the end-user experience. This allows you to fully customize nearly every aspect of your app.  When designing your Power Apps solution your goal should be to keep it simple.

                                        <li>Use Visio to create a wireframe diagram. A wireframe is a visual representation of an application's user interface.</li>
                                        <li>Use Power Apps to create a mockup of your application. You can add most of the controls, graphics, forms, and other items to your app screens and play with the layout and size for each element as if you were building the app for real</li>
