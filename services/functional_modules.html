                            <p>The entire Microsoft Dynamics CRM is designed around the following functional modules.<br><br>
                                These functional modules are often called as Work Areas.<br><br>
                                Understanding CRM Functional Modules<br><br>
                                The entire CRM application is divided functionally for different types of users and teams. Hence, if an organization is using CRM to manage its processes, the users from the Sales team would use the functionalities that come under the Sales module, while the users from the Marketing team would use functionalities that fall under the Marketing module.<br><br>
                                All these three functional modules come together to drive the entire lifecycle of gaining a new customer (Marketing), selling them the services (Sales) and maintaining the existing customers (Service Management).

                            <p>To understand this flow in a better way, consider a bank which sells credit cards to its customers. The typical lifecycle of selling a credit card to a customer would be as follows. In each step of this lifecycle, you will see how the Sales, Marketing and Service modules perform their role.</p>

The executive will followup to resolve the case with the aim to provide quality service to the customer. These tasks fall under CRM Service Management. </p>

                                <p>Dynamics 365 Customer Voice is an enterprise feedback management application you can use to easily keep track of the customer metrics that matter the most to your business. With deep integration from the Dynamics 365 line-of-business applications and built on Microsoft Forms, Dynamics 365 Customer Voice adds rich insights by feeding real-time survey data into customer records. Dynamics 365 Customer Voice provides an easy and friction-free experience, from creating surveys to generating actionable insights based on customer feedback with minimal setup time. It helps you to keep a pulse on what customers value and how they view your products and services, so you can rest assured that your data is supported by Microsoft security and compliance policies.</p>

                                <p>A survey can have up to 100 questions. Likert, choice, and ranking questions, along with their options/statements, count toward the overall 100-question limit. Therefore, if you include a Likert question with 10 statements, it will reduce the number of remaining questions to 90. The preceding figure shows a simple survey with a rating (smiley) question, a Net Promoter Score question, and a text field question. For longer surveys, a new section can be added after a question, creating pagination between blocks of questions. This approach can be a way to cleanly break up a survey that asks questions on different topics.</p>
