                    <p>Big data is the collection of voluminous amount of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. Big Data is defined as a collection of many complex data sets, derived from different data sources. The datasets are huge and the traditional data processing programs are not programmed to manage such high volume of data. However, this voluminous quantity of data turns out to be very useful for a company as proper analysis of the data helps to address and even solve business problems. </p>

                                <p>Big Data is synonymous to high volume of information. Big Data is defined by its enormous number of data sets. Information which forms a part of Big Data can be of unknown value, like the social media feeds or the clicks on a landing page. The volume of data depends from company to company. Some firms might gather terabytes of data while some have hundreds of petabytes generated through social media itself. </p>

                                <p>Data is flowing at a high speed thus, it needs to be collected and managed at a great pace as well. Business have to manage floods of data on a real time basis. Velocity is at times considered even more important than the volume of Big Data. As, it is the flow of data which can actually give a competitive edge to a business. Therefore, the speed of the collection of data is important. As, only when the information will flow quickly, the scientists will be able to analyze it to get real time insights. </p>

As, Big Data is expanding regularly, data is flowing even in unstructured patterns. Audio and video data can be termed as unstructured or semi-structured data and it needs special type of preprocessing to get insights from this type of data. However, variety of Big Data is extremely important and the latest Big Data technology at NEX makes it possible to store and analyze a large variety of data. </p>

Big Data experts drill down and find out important information from the huge collection of Big Data, and that information is termed as Big Data insights.

                    <p>The term ‘Big Data’ was first used in 1997 by scientists at NASA. The term was used to describe visualization problem linked to computer systems with huge data sets. However, later in the year 2013, Oxford English Dictionary officially introduced the term ‘Big Data’ for the very first time. However, now, Big Data has become a phenomenon in different areas as Big Data insights have positive influences in various sectors. </p>
                    <p>Though, it is interesting to know that the introduction of high volume data roots to the 1960s and '1970s. This was the era, when the market of data was started to build. However, later in 2005, people understood the ‘volume’ of data which is generated by various sources including digital media. Additionally, Hadoop, one of the most popular open-source framework used to manage analyze was introduced. </p>

                            <p>Big Data analytics started becoming more and more popular with the evolvement of the open-source frameworks. As, the volume of Big Data was soaring, so was the need of advanced programs to store, harness and analyze Big Data. Therefore, open source platforms like Hadoop and many other advanced Big Data platforms were constantly upgraded. And now, with the introduction of IoT, a lot more data related to the products, customer behavior, usage pattern etc. is generated. And, with the help of new-age Machine Learning tools, data analysis and application has become easier. In fact, the advent of cloud computing has further expanded the Big Data capabilities. </p>

                    <h3>Is Big Data actually voluminous?</h3>
                    <p>Big Data is a huge collection of information. There isn’t any upper or lower limit which defines the threshold of the data to be categorized as ‘Big Data’. As, Big Data is generated in different quantities and by different sources. The volume of Big Data can’t always be defined in terms of petabytes or zettabytes. When collection of data becomes difficult to store, analyze or share via any traditional database management tools, in that case, that huge dataset can be defined as Big Data; that’s the simplest explanation of Big Data. </p>

                    <p>Just gathering of Big Data is not enough. Big Data needs to be interpreted to get valuable insights, and this can’t be done using traditional methods. Big Data analysis aims to get hidden trends, patterns or information which might not even be seen through naked eye. Also, as Big Data sources and the quantity of data is increasing day by day, hence, companies have to implement new technologies and skills to drill down the data and get useful analytics. </p>
